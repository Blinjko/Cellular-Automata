# Cellular-Automata
Simple Elementry and Totalistic Cellular Automata Programs

This repository is a bit fast and loose but I figured I would post the work that I had done. I dont plan on really cleaning it up but feel free to use the code.


# Dependencies
These programs use Raylib for the graphics and rendering, so give those guys a look. I left the libraries I used in the repository so everything will build easily.

# Building
To build any of these simulations / programs just run the build.sh or you can read the code and figure out how it goes together. For a general reference though, compile error.c grid.c rules.c and main.c then link them with the raylib library. I made these on a Unix-like system so I cannot be sure that these will work on MS Windows, feel free to try it though.
