# John Conways Game of Life in Julia
I wanted to learn Julia, and I was doing cellular automata, so I figured I'd make one in Julia. Like the others this one uses Raylib, so check out those guys for making an awesome library. Also I used a simple raylib Julia binding created by irishgreencitrus, the repository name is raylib.jl. I also did make a few alterations to raylib.jl but other than that the work is all theirs.


## How to run
Simply do "julia cellular-automata.jl", note this requires julia to be installed and if you're on windows you need to get the raylib dll and place it in the same directory as "cellular-automata.jl".


## Controls
Here are the controls.
Hold space to pause & right click to delete / place a cell ( only while paused )
